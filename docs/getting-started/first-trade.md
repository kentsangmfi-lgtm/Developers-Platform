description: Create an access token, retrieve contract settings, and submit a market deal.
---

This guide creates a WebProxy session and access token, then submits a market deal to FxServer. Replace each placeholder with a value assigned to your environment.

## 1. Set your environment

```bash
export WEB_PROXY_URL="https://your-webproxy-host"
export FXSERVER_URL="https://your-fxserver-host"
export TRADER_USER="your-user-id"
export TRADER_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

Use these variables only in a secure local environment. In production, load credentials from a server-side secret manager and never expose them to client-side code.

## 2. Create a login session

```bash
curl --request POST "$WEB_PROXY_URL/api/session" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{
    \"checks\": {
      \"user\": {\"userId\": \"$TRADER_USER\"},
      \"password\": {\"password\": \"$TRADER_PASSWORD\"}
    }
  }"
```

Store `sessionToken` from the response:

```bash
export SESSION_TOKEN="session-token-from-the-login-response"
```

If the response contains a `challenge`, complete the required OTP check with `PATCH /api/session/{sessionId}` before continuing. See the [WebProxy API](../web-proxy/openapi.mdx) for the request schema.

## 3. Create and exchange an API key

Create a key with only the permissions your integration requires:

```bash
curl --request POST "$WEB_PROXY_URL/api/tokens/new" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SESSION_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "local-onboarding",
    "permissions": ["read", "trade"],
    "expirationDate": "2030-12-31"
  }'
```

The response body contains the API key as plain text. Store it securely:

```bash
export API_KEY="api-key-from-the-create-token-response"
```

Exchange the API key for a short-lived access token:

```bash
curl --request POST "$WEB_PROXY_URL/api/tokens/auth" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

Store `access_token` from the response for the remaining requests:

```bash
export ACCESS_TOKEN="access-token-from-the-token-exchange-response"
```

The `expires_in` value is measured in minutes. Exchange the existing API key again when the access token expires.

## 4. Retrieve the contract settings

This endpoint returns settings for all available contracts. Find the record whose `market` matches the contract you plan to trade:

```bash
curl "$WEB_PROXY_URL/api/contractSetting" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Calculate `amount` in contract units:

```text
amount = lotQuantity × contractSize
minimumAmount = minTradeLot × contractSize
incrementAmount = minLotIncrementUnit × contractSize
```

Send an amount that is at least `minimumAmount` and is a multiple of `incrementAmount`. For example, when `contractSize` is `100,000`, `0.01` lot is an `amount` of `1,000`.

## 5. Submit a market deal

Market mode uses FxServer's latest quote. Set `priceMode` to `1`, and omit `price` and `priceTag`. Replace `123456` with an integer that is unique for this logical request.

```bash
curl --request POST "$FXSERVER_URL/addDeal" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "clientOrderId": 123456,
    "priceMode": 1,
    "contractCode": "EURUSD",
    "amount": 1000,
    "buyOrSell": true
  }'
```

Use one `clientOrderId` per logical request. If the outcome is uncertain, retry with the same ID rather than generating a new one. A `409 Conflict` response means the server already accepted that ID for the account and trade date; reconcile the original request before taking further action.

## 6. Handle the outcome

- `200 OK` means the request completed successfully.
- `202 Accepted` means the request is still being processed. Inspect `type`, such as `HEDGE`, `DELAY`, or `MANUAL`, and do not treat the response as a completed deal.
- `400 Bad Request` means the request failed validation or a business rule. Inspect the response body.
- `401 Unauthorized` means authentication is missing, invalid, or expired.
- `409 Conflict` means the server already accepted the `clientOrderId` for the account and trade date.
- `429 Too Many Requests` means the request was rate limited.

Connect to `GET /updateEventStream` for position, order, execution, and cancellation updates. Store references returned by successful trade requests and reconcile the stream with the resulting position and order state.
